# Possum

Imagine if you could just convert any type of file (text, images, music...) into an image, just like a compressed file, but giving it a visual representation and an artistic touch as well.
Well, that's basically what Possum is about.

In a nutshell, it uses the color of each pixel of an image to store binary data, whatever it is: text, still images, GIFs, audio and even small videos!

Let me give you an example:
![Genesis](examples/GENESIS.png)
The image above, is the Book of Genesis, the first book of the Bible.
<br><br>
![Quijote](example/QUIJOTE.png)
The image above, is Don Quixote, the most influential work of literature from the entire Spanish literary canon.
<br><br>
![Breaking Bad](examples/BreakingBad.png)
The image above, is the song of the intro of Breaking Bad.
