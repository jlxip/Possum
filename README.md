# Possum

Imagine if you could just convert any type of file (text, images, music...) into an image, just like a compressed file, but giving it a visual representation and an artistic touch as well.<br>
Well, that's basically what Possum is about.
<br><br>

In a nutshell, it uses the color of each pixel of an image to store binary data, whatever it is: text, still images, GIFs, audio and even small videos!
<br><br>

Let me give you an example:<br><br>
![Genesis](examples/GENESIS.png)<br>
The image above, is the Book of Genesis, the first book of the Bible.
<br><br>
![Quijote](examples/QUIJOTE.png)<br>
The image above, is Don Quixote, the most influential work of literature from the entire Spanish literary canon.
<br><br>
![Breaking Bad](examples/BreakingBad.png)<br>
The image above, is the song of the intro of Breaking Bad.

## How does it work?
### Images and colors
The first thing you have to know about is how images work (if you already know this, [click here](#compression)):<br>
First of all, an image has dimensions which are usually measured in pixels (_e.g. 480x480, 640x480, etc._).<br>
These pixels are like really tiny squares that can have different colors. A bunch of pixels put together form an image, got it?<br>
Now, the color of a pixel is defined by its color code.<br>
Each color has its own color code, and there are a few ways to represent this. The easiest is RGB (_Red, Green, Blue_), in which a color is a value formed by 3 inner values (guess them: red, green and blue), these values go from 0 to 255. Nevertheless, in some images that allow it (such as PNG images) there is also a 4th value which is the opacity.<br>
So, different combinations of these values give different color codes that result in different colors. Easy, right?<br><br>
For example, the color red will be 100% red (255), 0% green (0) and 0% blue (0).<br>
And the color yellow will be 100% red (255), 100% green (255) and 0% blue (0).
<br><br>

### <a name='compression'></a>The compression
The application generates an array which contains every single byte of the input file.<br>
As we already know that a color can save up to 3 values (4 in theory, but not in practice), each value of red, green and blue is set with the decimal value of each pixel.<br><br>

Let me make this clear, if we have the following bytes:<br>
[104, 101, 108, 108, 111]<br>
We can convert them easily into the colors of two pixels:<br>
PIXEL 1 -> 104 red, 101 green, 108 blue<br>
PIXEL 2 -> 108 red, 111 green, 0 blue<br>
<br><br>

### <a name='structure'></a>The structure
Now you have to know that every single image generated by the application follows a structure (it's not mayhem), and it's manifested through different pixels.<br><br>

The structure is the following:<br>
The first pixel of the image, is an opaque (opacity of 100%) white pixel. It's used to check that the image can be read.<br>
The following pixels contain the MIME type (_text/plain_, _image/png_, etc.).<br>
Just after the MIME type, there is a reserved transparent pixel (opacity of 0%).<br>
After the reserved pixel, the content starts.<br>
The last pixel of the image is another transparent pixel, which tells the application that the content has finished.<br>
